**Authors:** Nils Hutter and Damien Ringeisen

**Description:** Code and data to reproduce the results presented in Ringeisen et al. (2023). The included notebooks compute intersection angle distributions and distributions of deformation rates along LKFs, as well as derive yield curves from intersection angle distributions. The intersection angle data sets have been extracted from three different LKF datasets:
1. RGPS: Hutter, Nils (2019): Linear Kinematic Features (leads & pressure ridges) detected and tracked in sea-ice deformation simulated in an Arctic configuration of MITgcm using a 2-km horizontal grid spacing from 1997 to 2008.

2. MOSAiC: Hutter, N. and von Albedyl, L. (*in submission* 2023): Linear Kinematic Features (leads & pressure ridges) detected and tracked in Sentinel-1 drift and deformation data during the MOSAiC expedition, PANGAEA
